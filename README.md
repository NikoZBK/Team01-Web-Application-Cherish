# Cherish App

In this README file, you will find a summary of what the Cherish App is all about and a brief explanation of all things we have acheived in each milestone. We will also list out all the requirements you will need in order to run this app in your local machines. 

## Instructions to run the app (once back end is integrated, update this as needed)
1. Clone the github repo into your VS code.
2. Once its cloned, make sure you are in the main branch. Open up a terminal and run **npm install**.
3. Once the node files have been installedm go to the index page that is located in the front-end folder. You can either open a live server from the index.html page or write **npm start**. This will open up our app


## Milestone 1
For M1, we formed our group of 7 members: Anugrah George, Nikolay Ostroukhov, Robert Thurston, Jesse Goldman, Samuel Hernandez, Wacil Voiltaire, Liam Campbell. We decided to use discord as our communication platform and we started off to brainstorm ideas of our project. Each member brought specifc skills to accomplish this project. We finally 

## Milestone 2 - Web Application Concept and Design 
For M2, we came up with the idea for our project - Cherish. The app is very similar to most of the journal / mood tracking apps you see today where the users can log in their emotions or journal and the app will give certain feedbacks that help their users for their mental health. During this milestone, all of our members collaborated on their team member reports and how they can contribute towards the development of this app. We also sketched our front end design through Figma and figured out all the interactive functions and pages users can utilize.

## Milestone 3 - Front End Design
For M3, we began bringing our app to life starting with the front end. We uesd the figma design which was helpful to visualize what the app should look like. We created our important components and made sure each page has its own components that can talk to other pages as well.

## Milestone 4 - Back End Design
For M4, we assigned a lot of features to ourselves to add functionality to our app but not limited to team work. Here you will find what each member mostly worked on:
 1. Calendar Streak: **George** brought up this feature proposal where the calendar page shows you how many days in a row the user has been logging in their emotions / journal entries. Each day will be underlined if the user has at least 1 entry logged in. This will be useful as most users today love the idea of keeping a streak therefore encouraging them to track how they are feeling.
