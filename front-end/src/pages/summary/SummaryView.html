            <div class="text">Hey Jack! Here’s a quick recap of your day: You woke up feeling pretty groggy since you didn’t get much sleep, and even coffee couldn’t shake off the tiredness. Things got better when you had lunch with your friends. It sounds like that really lifted your mood — lots of laughs and a good chance to catch up. You spent some time working on your project, but it was tough to stay focused with all the distractions getting in the way. You tried unwinding by watching a show, but it didn’t fully help. That lingering stress made it hard to relax. And yeah, the test today was pretty rough. You didn’t feel as prepared as you wanted, which added to the day’s challenges. Sounds like it was a bit of a mixed day — but hey, you made it through!</div>
            <div class="text">Life feels like flipping through a book where some pages are stuck together and others are missing entirely. Some moments flow effortlessly, like they were always meant to happen, while others leave me standing at a crossroads wondering if I missed a sign along the way. It’s strange how time slips between our fingers — we try to hold onto meaning, but meaning seems more like water than stone.</div>
            <div class="text">The stats page shows multiple metrics such as streak length and averages for each emotion. There's a lot that we can store here to let the user know how they're doing.</div>
