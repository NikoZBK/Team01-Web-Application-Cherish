# Problem Statement

## Problem Description
In todayâ€™s fast-paced society, people are often too busy to reflect on their emotional well-being. Often many people neglect it. Studies show a significant rise in mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, especially among younger generations. Many struggle to understand or process their emotions, which can lead to repeating harmful patterns and behaviors without realizing the underlying causes. Without consistent reflection, it becomes harder to identify emotional triggers and manage mental health effectively.

## Proposed Solution
Our web app provides a simple yet impactful platform for users to reflect on and track their emotions throughout the day. By logging feelings regularly, users can identify trends and triggers over time (daily, weekly, monthly). This reflection helps users understand what specific events or interactions lead to certain emotions, promoting emotional clarity and awareness. The app is designed to be quick and easy to use, taking only a few minutes each day. Our desired goal is to have people consistently coming back to journal their day to day emotions and continue to have a positive trend of their mental health while using our application.

**Key Features**
  - Reflect their emotions daily either once or multiple times a day.
  - An overview / summary of their week or month.
  - Rate their day with emotions and see previous days that are color coded with emotions.

## Why This Matters
Tracking emotions promotes self-awareness, which is crucial for personal growth. By recognizing emotional patterns, users can make proactive changes to improve their mental well-being. Over time, the app helps users build emotional resilience and confidence as they learn to navigate their feelings more effectively. Journalism daily also encourages accountability, enabling users to track their progress and reflect on how they've handled challenges.
