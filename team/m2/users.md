## User Needs

Teenagers are often navigating significant transitions, such as changes in school, friendships, and personal identity. Rather than seeking for a physical entry like a book or a sheet to track their emotions, we brainstormed an app that allows them to track their emotions in a straightforward and quick way, helping them reflect on their feelings daily without much effort. The app will offer the ability to track their day using simple predefined options making it easy for them to express how they're feeling without needing to write extensively. Additionally, we would like to develop the app where it can summarize their emotional trends that can provide valuable insights and also something that can aid in their personal growth and support their emotional development during these crucial years.

While primarily targeted at teenagers, the app is flexible enough to be used by young adults or college students. It can efficiently function as a journal for quick, on-the-go entries, allowing users to track their emotions by submitting once or multiple times in a given day while balancing schoolwork, social life, and extracurricular activities. This feature also encourages open conversations with family members, making it easier to discuss their emotional well-being in a safe and structured way. The visual representation of emotional patterns empowers them to understand their stressors better and find ways to practice self-care.

Moreover, our audience need an app that feels intuitive and easy to use, without technological barriers that might discourage regular engagement. By providing a simple way to visualize trends, the app fosters a positive outlook and supports teens and young adults in building emotional resilience as well as helping them maintain a balanced mental health approach as they navigate the ups and downs of adolescence.
