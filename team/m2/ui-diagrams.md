### UI DIAGRAM

**Sketch:**
This is an initial sketch of our UI design, created by Robbie. The layout features a 
clean and straightforward main screen displaying the calendar. Users can click on specific 
dates to navigate to a dedicated screen for logging their emotions. Additionally, the main page 
includes a link to a statistics tab, where users can view various insights based 
on their calendar entries.
