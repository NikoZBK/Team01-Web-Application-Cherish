## Team 1 Notes

### October 10, 2024
- Web app was planned:  
  - We will use George’s idea of creating **"Cherish"** or **"Calendar Cherish"**, a calendar app for tracking moods/feelings throughout the month.  
  - Users will rate each day with **bad, neutral, good, or great** and can also describe their day.  
  - Discussed potentially adding an **AI summary feature** where ChatGPT provides a summary of the week, month, or year.  
  - The UI of the app will be relatively simple to avoid overwhelming the user, making it enjoyable and engaging to use.
