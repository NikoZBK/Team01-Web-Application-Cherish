  - **Task**: Brought up an innovative project idea 
  - **Details**: Brainstormed the idea of an application where it will prompt the user at the end of the day to label the day 
  within the 5 options: Worst, Bad, Neutral, Good, Best. Each emotion is tied up to a color and the app will color the day for the user. Overtime it will give more 
  details and statistics on what kind of days you mostly have, and also recapping memories, etc.
