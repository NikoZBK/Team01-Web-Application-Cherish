- **Task**: Implement the click functionality for the days in the calendar.
- **Details**: New branch: `feature-main-page-clickable-calendar-niko`. Added click functionality to the days in the calendar. When a day is clicked, the user is redirected to the day page for that day. Also added a hover effect to the days in the calendar. Refactored the div creation code from direct html to javascript. Each click on a day passes the day's date to the day page.
